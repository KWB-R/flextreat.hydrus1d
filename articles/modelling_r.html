<p>This workflow is based on using the R package <a href="https://kwb-r.github.io/kwb.hydrus1d/" class="external-link">kwb.hydrus1d</a>, which is compatible with the last official release of <a href="https://www.pc-progress.com/en/Default.aspx?H1d-downloads" class="external-link">HYDRUS1D v4.17.0140</a>. The development of this new <code>R package</code> was necessary, due to the fact that already available model wrappers were developed for outdated <code>HYDRUS1D</code> versions (e.g.  python package <a href="https://github.com/phydrus/phydrus" class="external-link">phydrus</a> requires <a href="https://github.com/phydrus/source_code/issues/1#issuecomment-1034675697" class="external-link">HYDRUS1D v4.08</a>) and/or are not well maintained (e.g. open issues/pull requests for R package <a href="https://github.com/shoebodh/hydrusR" class="external-link">hydrusR</a>).</p>
<p>The workflow below describes all the steps required for:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Input data preparation</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modifying</strong> (i.e. <code>atmospheric</code> input data defined in file <code>ATMOSPHERE.in</code>) an already pre-prepared <code>HYDRUS1D</code> model (using the <code>HYDRUS1D GUI</code>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Running</strong> it from within <code>R</code> by using the command line (<code>cmd</code>) and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Importing</strong> and <strong>analysing</strong> the <code>HYDRUS1D</code> results within R.</p></li>

<p>Soil data is derived from depth-dependent grain-size analysis of soil samples taken in Braunschweig. The following required input parameters for the <code>van Genuchten</code> model used in <code>HYDRUS1D</code> were derived by using the pedotransfer function <a href="http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/ROSETTA-API.html" class="external-link">ROSETTA-API version 3</a>, which was developed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.01.004" class="external-link">Zhang and Schaap, 2017</a>.</p>
